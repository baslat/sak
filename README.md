# sak

`sak` is my Swiss Army knife package, and it’s also where I put things.
It has a whole bunch of random helper functions to make my life a bit
easier.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("baslat/sak")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(sak)
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
