`sak` is my Swiss Army knife package, and it's also where I put things. It has a
whole bunch of random helper functions to make my life a bit easier.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("baslat/sak")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sak)
## What are the unique values in each non-numeric dataframe column?
sg(dplyr::storms)
```
